## ⚠️ Important Notes for Mobile App Developer

### Exam Access Flow
1. **Check Password Requirement**: Use `exam.requiresOtp` from exam list
2. **Verify Password First**: If `requiresOtp: true`, call `/exams/{id}/verify-otp` BEFORE starting attempt
3. **Start Attempt**: Only after password verified (or if no password required)
4. **Get Questions**: After attempt started, fetch exam details with `/exams/{id}`

### Timer Management
- **START**: When you receive `start_time` from start attempt API
- **CALCULATE**: Current elapsed time = `now - start_time`
- **DURATION**: Exam duration is in `exam.duration` (minutes) or `exam.duration_seconds` (seconds)
- **AUTO-SUBMIT**: When elapsed time ≥ duration, automatically submit with current answers

### Duration Tracking
- Track time on client side in **seconds**
- Send `duration_taken` in **seconds** when submitting
- API receives exam duration in **minutes** but converts to seconds for validation
- If time exceeded, API still accepts but logs it and returns different message

### Answer Storage
- Store answers locally as student progresses
- On auto-submit, send all collected answers (even if some are incomplete)
- Missing answers won't crash - API will just not award points for them

### Error Handling
- **Already completed**: Don't allow re-entry to exam
- **Not started yet**: Show countdown to exam start time
- **Already ended**: Show "Exam has closed" message
- **Connection issues**: Save answers locally, retry submission

### Validation Before Submit
```dart
// Recommended client-side checks
bool canSubmit(Attempt attempt) {
  if (attempt.status == 'submitted') {
    return false; // Already submitted
  }
  
  if (answers.isEmpty) {
    showWarning('No answers collected');
    return true; // Still allow submission
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### Password Verification UI Flow
```dart
// Recommended UI flow for password-protected exams
Future<void> accessExam(Exam exam) async {
  // Check if password required
  if (exam.requiresOtp) {
    // Show password dialog
    String? password = await showPasswordDialog();
    
    if (password == null) {
      return; // User cancelled
    }
    
    // Verify password
    var result = await apiService.verifyExamPassword(
      exam.exam_id, 
      studentId, 
      password
    );
    
    if (!result.verified) {
      showError('Invalid exam password');
      return; // Don't proceed
    }
  }
  
  // Password verified or not required - start exam
  await startExamAttempt(exam.assignment_id);
}
```
